# Writing Systems In Shianese

Shianese utilizes multiple writing systems to represent its sounds and characters. These writing systems include:&#x20;

* **Hiragana**
* **Katakana**
* **Romaji**
* **Special Characters**

{% hint style="success" %}
All writing systems in Shianese are _relatively_ equal, which means that you can use Hiragana, Katakana, and Romaji interchangibly, but...
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When refering to abbreviated words or initialisms that are usually not translated, such UFO, you should always use uppercase Romaji.
{% endhint %}
